<b>The year is 1513.</b> There is a Grand Duchy built on traditional elven homelands, and in that Duchy there is the capital of Twilight Axis, and it is the end of the world.

Thousands of years ago, Psydon sent down the Comet Syon to defeat the rampaging Archdevil Vheslyn that scoured and pillaged the holy world of Psydonia. The Archdevil was slain, sent back to her home-plane- but Psydon was wounded, and fell into a deep, deep slumber (or into a shallow death?) from which he did not stir. The impact shattered him into his Ten children- Ten shards of him that guided humenity and the other races from the primordial era they were birthed from.
<br>
But times change.
<br>
<br>
The Age of Enlightenment was a great period in the mortal races' years, where the Empire of the Holy Celestia, guided by the blessings of the Ten, brought there was unprecedented peace and prosperity across Psydonia. As the mortals expanded their power and understanding of the world around them, the Ten fell into the background, perhaps being overtaken by the same gradual sleep that plied Psydon. Great Wonders were built, and the mortal races learned. And the mortal races Ascended. In 1311, the archmage Zaelorion Crynsaris, proudest of the snow elves, ascended to Divinity. Mortals learned they could play Gods.
<br>
<br>
And Mortals learned that they could ascend; that they could play Gods. And so ZIZO rose to the front of the Ascendants- mortals that had, in their own right, ascended to True Divinity. And so, the Age of Enlightenment ended with fire- the Snow Elf race exterminated, the holy Empire of the Ten extinguished, the advancements and knowledge of the eras so-shattered.

<br>
Psydonia rots. Psydonia decays; scent of shit and pus and maggot-filth in the air. The Holy See controls diocese around the world that worship The Ten ever-so-faithfully...but trouble brews. Two-hundred years ago, the Church underwent a harsh schism in the dying embers of the Age of Enlightenment and of the fracturing of the empire. The Holy Ecclesial split, preaching the Ascendant. The Ten were weak, they said- and the Ascendant were what would save mortals upon this dying coil.

<br>
<b>Children of the Ten, Psydonia is under attack by the Inhumen Ascendant and ever-creeping Archdevils-</b> will you lose your faith in the Ten that have guided and nurtured you?
<br>
<b>Glorious Ecclestials, Worshipper of Ascendants, the Ten are weak and the church is corrupt-</b> will you rise up and rewrite a world in your image, stronger and more resilient?
<br>
<b>Holy Lamb, Sacrificial Hero, Blessed Idiot, PSYDON endures-</b> will you yet endure as stoically and wilfully as he does, for all of humenkind?
<br>
<b>Lowly fool- will you save your world?</b>
